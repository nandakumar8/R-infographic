--------The Graphic------
The graphic talks about the decision to go for public or
Private universities. Many people tend to take these
decisions based on the availability of federal aid and scholarships.
The predominant perception is that the public universities offer
more scholarship and are more cheaper to attend than their
private counterparts. The graphic explains how federal aid distribution
in private universities along with the endowment dollars help make private
Universities a lot cheaper to attend.

-----------Audience--------
The graphic is primarily used by students while taking decisions between
universtities ,but it can also be used by researchers in the education field

---------Source--------------
Data is obtained from the data planet website and national post secondary
education survey website


The graphs explain different parameters. The first choropleth explains the federal aid distribution for all universities in all states for 2012.
Based on the map,we can see that the California state , Texas , Florida and the northeast region have the most concentration of federal aid.
Based on this data,the top public and private universities in these regions are considered. The barchart explains the total enrollment in
these universities. We can see that public university enrollment is far higher than the private institutions. This is a pattern across all
private and public universities. The pie chart considers the number of people who got federal aid and plots the percentage of people who
got aid.We can see that private institution aid distribution is almost similar to that of their public counterparts. The line chart also proves
this point.The chart shows the total federal aid received by the public and private institutions in two recent years.We can see that
eventhough the public institutions receive more aid,the difference is mostly negligible. In fact,in certain cases some public institutions
actually receive lesser aid money. Lastly the bubble chart shows the endowment received by the top twenty institutions in the united
states.We find that 70% of the institutions are private. Most of the institutions that receive large endowments are private.
Given all these factors,a student has a lot better chance to get scholarships in a private university and help attending
college a stress free experience.
